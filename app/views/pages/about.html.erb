  <h1 class='text-center about-header'>About Tasky</h1>
  <h3 class="padding-about-body">Tasky is a TODO app that allows users to create their own account as well as being able to log in using their facebook.  Once you're signed in you can create a task under the "TO DO" section. When you're ready to work on your "TO DO" you click the right arrow button which sends your task to the "DOING" section. In the "DOING" section you have the option to send your task back to "TO DO" if you have decided you're not ready to work on that task yet or if you complete your task send it to the "DONE" section. I created this app for my Rails Portfolio Project for The FlatIron School. Feel free to checkout more of my projects at my<a href="https://www.github.com/jhyatt1017" target="_blank"> Github</a> </h3>
